## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Scientist and Computational Physicist with over a decade of experience decoding complex dynamical systems. My work operates at the cutting edge of Generative AI for Science, moving beyond static structure prediction to model the breathing, moving reality of biological machinery.

Unusually for a researcher, I have maintained a parallel career as a fractional Head of AI through Sengar Consulting BV. This dual track—publishing at NeurIPS while simultaneously shipping production-grade models for Fintech and Biotech clients—has sharpened my ability to translate abstract mathematics into high-ROI business applications.

My scientific journey has spanned Europe’s leading institutions, including Imperial College London, EPFL, TU Eindhoven, and collaborations with Cambridge and MIT. I have mentored over 10 researchers and orchestrated cross-border projects connecting scientists in the US, Korea, and the EU.


## My core philosophy

I believe that the next breakthrough in drug discovery will come from marrying the rigorous priors of statistical physics with the generative power of geometric deep learning. Whether developing Latent Diffusion models for protein ensembles at EPFL or designing Bayesian Attack Graphs for cybersecurity clients, I focus on building systems that are not just accurate, but physically plausible and interpretable.

## International & Cross‑Cultural Work

My academic journey has taken me across Europe’s leading institutions — **University of Cambridge**, **University of Surrey**, **Imperial College London**, **TU Delft**, **Utrecht University**, **Eindhoven University of Technology** and **EPFL** — giving me a truly global perspective on research and teaching.  In parallel with academia, my consulting practice has connected me with researchers and entrepreneurs across the **United States**, **Korea**, **Saudi Arabia**, the **European Union** and **India**.  These diverse collaborations have sharpened my ability to communicate complex ideas across cultures and to deliver high‑quality work in a wide range of contexts.

## Awards & Fellowships

- **Marie Skłodowska‑Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship – Certificate of Excellence (with Prof. Max Welling)**:
  proposed a project on generative modeling of RNA dynamics using graph neural networks and latent diffusion. The
  proposal received a certificate of excellence.
- **SNSF Postdoc.Mobility Fellowship (Score: 8.31/9)**: proposed a generative model to detect the effect of
  small‑molecule ligands on G‑protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) using GNNs and latent diffusion in a low‑dimensional
  space.
- **IIT‑JEE 2011**: achieved a rank within the 99.9th percentile, earning admission to **IIT Delhi**.

## Grants & Funding Experience

I have extensive experience in writing grant proposals and securing funding. I have written or co‑written
successful grant applications for **EU agencies, NIH, SNSF, and UKRI**, spanning topics from machine learning to
chemical engineering.

## Software & Technical Skills

- **Python** (Pandas, scikit‑learn, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow): used in 15+ projects, including three postdoctoral
  research projects and a dozen consulting engagements.
- **Mathematica**: used in over 10 projects (including three at the postdoctoral level, three during my PhD, and
  several in undergraduate research).
- **C**: used in three PhD‑level projects.
- **C++**: taught C++ to Master’s students during my PhD; used in one undergraduate project.
- **Linux & HPC**: extensive experience running simulations and managing computational clusters.
- **Matlab**: used in three freelancing projects and more than ten projects/assignments during my undergraduate
  studies.
- **Java**: used in five projects prior to university.
- **Docker, Kubernetes, Run:AI**: used to containerize and orchestrate machine‑learning workflows, including
  multi‑GPU and distributed training.

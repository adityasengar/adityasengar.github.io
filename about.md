## About Me

I am an interdisciplinary computational researcher with over eight years of experience in software development, machine learning, and molecular simulations. My academic and professional work has spanned multiple scientific domains, including nucleic acids research, chemical reaction network theory, and fluid mechanics, with a more recent focus on leveraging artificial intelligence for structural biology.

### Current Research: Generative Models for Protein Dynamics

Currently, I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher at EPFL** in Switzerland. My primary focus is on **developing generative models for protein dynamics**.

Our latest research introduces a new framework capable of generating protein dynamics at an all-atom level as easily as state-of-the-art models generate images. Using latent diffusion models built upon ChebNet graph neural networks (GNNs), we can now recover full protein ensembles, including the intricate dance of side chainsâ€”a critical breakthrough for understanding protein function. This work aims to accelerate drug discovery by providing a clearer picture of the dynamic nature of protein targets.

### Background & Experience

Before joining EPFL, I was a Research Associate at **Imperial College London**, where I developed novel numerical methods for the oxDNA toolkit to analyze the kinetics and thermodynamics of DNA-based systems. This involved building a multimodal AI platform to predict DNA binding rates and studying sequence-structure-function relationships in various DNA reactions.

I earned my PhD (cum laude) from **Eindhoven University of Technology**. My research there led to the development of a kinetic Monte Carlo reactor that significantly advanced the understanding of chemical processes involved in high-octane fuel production.

Beyond academia, I have applied my expertise through my data science consulting company, **Sengar Consulting BV**. I have successfully delivered over 30 projects in areas such as biotechnology, drug discovery, immunotherapy, and computer network security, using cutting-edge models including diffusion models, transformers, and reinforcement learning.

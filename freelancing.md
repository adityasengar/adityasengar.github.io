## Machine Learning Projects

<details>
<summary><strong>Advancing Counterfactual Explanations for Credit Risk Modeling</strong></summary>
<p>
This project built an adaptive framework for generating human-readable counterfactuals in credit risk modelling using genetic algorithms. The system proposes plausible changes (e.g., decreasing debt or increasing savings) that would improve a loan applicant’s outcome while respecting financial regulations. By focusing on interpretability and fairness, the work helps lenders explain credit decisions to customers and regulators.

<summary><strong>Pioneering Personalized Medicine through AI</strong></summary>
<p>
In this research the goal was to leverage generative AI for personalised drug design. The system explores the combinatorial space of CRISPR guide RNA sequences and small molecules, optimising them for efficacy, safety and target specificity. By integrating genetic data and machine learning, the approach aims to suggest tailored therapies for individual patients.

<summary><strong>Development of a Seq2Seq Chatbot with PyTorch</strong></summary>
<p>
This project involved building a conversational chatbot using a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention in PyTorch. The model was trained on a large corpus of dialogues and was fine-tuned for domain-specific customer support tasks. The resulting chatbot can handle multi-turn conversations and provide context-aware responses.

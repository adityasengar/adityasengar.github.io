## Machine Learning Projects

<details>
<summary><strong>Advancing Counterfactual Explanations for Credit Risk Modelling</strong></summary>
<p>
This project built an adaptive framework for generating human‑readable counterfactuals in credit risk modelling using genetic algorithms. The system proposes plausible changes (e.g., decreasing debt or increasing savings) that could improve a loan applicant’s outcome while respecting financial regulations. By focusing on interpretability and fairness, the work helps lenders explain credit decisions to customers and regulators.

<summary><strong>Pioneering Personalized Medicine through AI</strong></summary>
<p>
In this research the goal was to leverage generative AI for personalised drug design. The system explores the combinatorial space of CRISPR guide RNA sequences and small molecules, optimising them for efficacy, safety and target specificity. By integrating genetic data and machine learning, the approach aims to suggest tailored therapies for individual patients.

<summary><strong>Development of a Seq2Seq Chatbot with PyTorch</strong></summary>
<p>
This project involved building a conversational chatbot using a sequence‑to‑sequence architecture with attention in PyTorch. The model was trained on a large corpus of dialogues and was fine‑tuned for domain‑specific customer support tasks. The resulting chatbot can handle multi‑turn conversations and provide context‑aware responses.

<summary><strong>Evolutionary Games and Reinforcement Learning: Modelling Interactions in a Simulated World</strong></summary>
<p>
By combining evolutionary game theory with reinforcement learning, this project simulated interactions among humans, robots and AI agents in a shared environment. The model explored how strategy adaptation influences cooperation, competition and resource sharing. It sheds light on the dynamics of populations where actors learn from experience and evolve their behaviours.

<summary><strong>Machine Learning Models for Anomaly Detection in API Security</strong></summary>
<p>
This work focused on detecting anomalous API usage patterns that may indicate security breaches. Using clustering algorithms and supervised classifiers, the models learn normal behaviour from usage logs and flag deviations. The project contributes to proactive cyber security by catching unusual access attempts early.

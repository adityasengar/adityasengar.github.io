# From Noise to Art: The Complete Guide to Diffusion Models

*July 3, 2025*

If you've been anywhere near the AI space recently, you've seen the stunning images produced by models like DALL-E 3, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. The technology behind many of these state-of-the-art generators is a class of models known as **Diffusion Models**.

At first glance, their inner workings seem almost magical. They start with pure random noise and meticulously sculpt it into a coherent, often beautiful, image. But how? This post offers a comprehensive guide, from the foundational theory of **score matching** to the practical implementations in **DDPMs**, and finally to the unified, high-performance framework of **EDM** (Elucidating Diffusion Models).

## Part 1: The Core Theory - Score-Based Generation

Before we can denoise an image, we must first understand what our model is fundamentally trying to learn. The goal of any generative model is to learn the probability distribution of the training data, $p(x)$. If we can learn this distribution, we can sample from it to create new data.

### The Score Function: A Guiding Field for Creativity

The challenge is that $p(x)$ is incredibly complex. A more tractable quantity to work with is its **score function**, which is the gradient of the log-probability of the data with respect to the input:

$$
\text{score} = \nabla_x \log p(x)
$$

Think of the data distribution as a landscape with mountains where the data is dense (e.g., images of cats) and valleys where it's sparse. The **score function at any point `x` is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest ascent up the nearest mountain**. It's a guiding field that always points toward regions of higher data density.

If we had this magical guiding field, we could start with a random point (random noise) and take small steps in the direction of the score, eventually climbing a mountain and arriving at a plausible data sample (a realistic image). This is the core idea behind sampling with methods like **Langevin dynamics**.

### The Problem and the Solution: Denoising Score Matching

The problem is, we can't get the score function for the true data distribution $p(x)$ directly. This is where a key insight comes in: **Denoising Score Matching**.

Instead of trying to model the score of clean data, what if we model the score of data corrupted by various levels of Gaussian noise? It turns out that for a noisy data point $x_t$ (created by adding noise with variance $\sigma^2$ to a clean point $x_0$), there's a beautiful connection: the score of the noised data distribution, $\nabla_{x_t} \log p(x_t)$, is equivalent to predicting the noise that was added.

This reframes the problem entirely! Instead of a complex score estimation task, we just need a model that can look at a noisy image and estimate the noise that was added. The pioneering work in this area was **NCSN (Noise Conditional Score Networks)**.

## Part 2: The Practical Recipe - DDPMs

**Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)** can be understood as a practical, discrete-time recipe built on these score-based principles.

### The Forward Process: Creating the Noisy Data

DDPM defines a fixed forward process over `T` discrete timesteps to generate the noisy images needed for training. This is a **Variance Preserving (VP)** process defined by a noise schedule `βt`.

* The single-step transition is:
    $$
    x_t = \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \cdot x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t} \cdot \epsilon_{t-1} \quad \text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
    $$
* Crucially, we can jump to any step `t` directly from the original image `x₀`. Let $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^{t} \alpha_i$:
    $$
    x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} \cdot x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \cdot \epsilon
    $$

### The Reverse Process: Learning the Score by Predicting Noise

The DDPM U-Net model, $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$, is trained to predict the noise `ϵ` from the noisy image `x_t`. This act of predicting the noise is **implicitly learning the score function**. The simple and effective loss function is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{simple}} = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon} \left[ || \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) ||^2 \right]
$$

To generate an image, DDPM uses an **ancestral sampler**. It starts with pure noise $x_T$ and iterates backwards. Each step `t` involves:
1.  Using the model $\epsilon_\theta$ to predict the noise.
2.  Using this prediction to estimate the direction towards the cleaner image $x_{t-1}$.
3.  Adding a small amount of random noise back in, inspired by Langevin dynamics.

This process is inherently **stochastic** and **slow**, as it requires all `T` steps (e.g., 1000) to produce an image.

## Part 3: The Unified Framework - EDM's Breakthroughs

The **EDM (Elucidating Diffusion Models)** paper brilliantly unified the score-based perspective of NCSN and the probabilistic view of DDPM into a single, high-performance framework.

### Unifying Theory: The Denoiser IS the Score Estimator

EDM makes the connection between denoising and score matching explicit. It defines a **denoiser function** `D(x; σ)` that aims to predict the clean image `x₀` from a noisy input `x` with noise level `σ`.

The estimated score can then be derived directly from this denoiser's output:

$$
\nabla_{x} \log p(x; \sigma) \approx \frac{D(x; \sigma) - x}{\sigma^2}
$$

*This is the missing link!* The model's primary job is to denoise (`D`), and from that, we can instantly get the guiding field (the score) we need for generation.

To make the denoiser `D(x; σ)` work reliably across all noise levels, EDM introduces **principled preconditioning**. The final denoiser is a wrapper around the U-Net `F_θ`:

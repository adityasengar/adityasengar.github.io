# Introduction: A New Era in Structural Biology

The last few years have seen a revolution in structural biology, driven by the breakneck speed of advances in artificial intelligence. This post is the first in a series where we will deconstruct the key architectures that have defined this new era. Our journey will take us from the deterministic brilliance of AlphaFold 2 to the generative power of modern diffusion models like Boltz-2.

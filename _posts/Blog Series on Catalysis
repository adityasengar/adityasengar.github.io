## Writings from Imperial College London

During my time as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Imperial College London, I authored a series of blog posts for the university's Molecular Science and Engineering blog. Below are excerpts from that series, with links to the full articles on the Imperial College website.

### Catalysis through the ages 1 – Birth of an industry

**Published:** October 23, 2020

**Summary:** This post explores the history of catalysis, from its roots in ancient practices like brewing to its pivotal role in modern science. It highlights key moments, such as the development of the Haber process for ammonia synthesis and the accidental discovery of polyethylene, showing how catalysis evolved from alchemy into a cornerstone of massive global industries.

### Catalysis through the ages 2 – energy catalysts

**Published:** October 30, 2020

**Summary:** This article discusses the critical role of catalysts in the world's energy landscape. It covers the transition from coal to crude oil, driven by processes like catalytic cracking, and looks toward the future of cleaner alternatives, including synthetic fuels from the Fischer-Tropsch process, biofuels, and fuel cells.

### Catalysis through the ages 3 – electrocatalysts of the future

**Published:** November 6, 2020

**Summary:** This post explores how electrocatalysts could be key to solving the global energy crisis. It explains how using electric currents to drive reactions—like splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen—could allow us to produce clean fuels from abundant resources like water and CO2, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and paving the way for a greener future.

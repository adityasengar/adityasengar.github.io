## Developing a Generative AI Framework for All‑Atom Protein Dynamics

![LD‑FPG Figure](/images/LDFPG.png)

A major challenge in computational biology is capturing the full range of motion of proteins, as their function is intimately linked to their dynamics. To address this, I co‑conceived and helped develop **Latent Diffusion for Full Protein Generation (LD‑FPG)**.  My contribution centred on designing and implementing the machine‑learning pipeline: a spectral graph neural network autoencoder coupled to a latent‑diffusion model.  I also validated the method on a complex, medically relevant target — the human dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) — showing that LD‑FPG can generate complete, all‑atom conformational ensembles directly from molecular‑dynamics data.

Our framework reproduced both the global backbone architecture and the distributions of side‑chain dihedral angles — dynamics essential for molecular recognition.  This work provides an efficient tool to study the dynamics of challenging proteins and opens new avenues for structure‑based drug design.  In the spirit of open science, I curated and released a full D2R molecular‑dynamics dataset along with the complete LD‑FPG codebase to encourage further innovation.

### Video demonstration of LD‑FPG model (EPFL work)

To illustrate the power of our **Latent Diffusion for Full Protein Generation** framework, below are two clips from our trained models.  The first shows raw molecular‑dynamics (MD) snapshots of the human PKC‑δ C1 domain followed by frames generated by LD‑FPG.  You can see how the model captures backbone flexibility, helix breathing and loop motions.  The second clip shows another protein (3dAN).  Once trained, LD‑FPG can generate thousands of physically realistic, all‑atom conformations in seconds — ideal for ensemble docking, AI‑augmented scoring and any workflow requiring a rich representation of protein motion.

## Major Achievements at Imperial — DNA Nanotechnology & Biomolecular Systems

![oxDNA Primer Figure](/images/oxdna.jpg)

I combined method development, simulations and theoretical analysis to advance DNA nanotechnology using the oxDNA framework.  This work, showcased at multiple international conferences and through several posters, tackled fundamental challenges in DNA design and function.

### 1. Free‑energy mapping of four‑way DNA junctions

Using enhanced sampling techniques based on oxDNA, I mapped the free‑energy profile of four‑way DNA junctions — crucial intermediates in strand‑displacement reactions.  Surprisingly, introducing bulges actually destabilizes the junction due to entropy penalties.  This finding challenges conventional assumptions and provides guidance for designing more robust DNA nanostructures.

### 2. Kinetic proofreading in nonenzymatic DNA strand displacement

I applied oxDNA to model a **kinetic proofreading (KP)** mechanism in nonenzymatic strand‑displacement systems.  The study provided quantitative reaction‑rate estimates and showed that operating under out‑of‑equilibrium conditions dramatically enhances recognition of single‑nucleotide mismatches.  These insights inform highly specific applications such as single‑nucleotide polymorphism detection and DNA‑based diagnostics.

### 3. oxDNA primer: when to use it, how to simulate, how to interpret

We produced a detailed primer on the oxDNA coarse‑grained model.  The article explains model variants (oxDNA1/oxDNA2), force‑field details, sequence‑dependent parameterization and mapping to experimental units.  It also walks through simulation protocols — **Langevin dynamics**, **Monte Carlo** and advanced accelerated sampling methods such as **Virtual Move Monte Carlo (VMMC)** — demonstrating how these can speed up equilibration of large, strongly interacting DNA structures.  Worked examples show how VMMC explores conformations of DNA origami and multi‑strand assemblies and combine with umbrella sampling to obtain free‑energy profiles.  The primer also details analysis workflows for computing structural observables, thermodynamic quantities and reaction pathways, providing a benchmark reference for reproducible oxDNA studies.

#### Additional method

I developed a **fast‑kinetics sampling workflow** in oxDNA to study dynamic events such as DNA bubble formation; this approach has since been adopted by groups at the University of Cambridge and MIT (submitted).

## Developing a “Molecule‑to‑Reactor” Computational Pipeline to Advance Catalytic Engineering

![Multiscale Catalyst Modeling](/images/reactor.jpg)

My research has addressed a critical barrier in chemical engineering: connecting molecular‑level surface events to macroscopic reactor performance.  I developed a particle‑based computational‑fluid‑dynamics framework that provides a unified, multiscale view of catalytic processes.  The core innovation was resolving small‑scale physics — diffusion and surface reactions — while seamlessly operating at the scale of industrial reactors.  The model was designed and validated to switch between reaction‑, diffusion‑ and convection‑dominated regimes, a versatility previously out of reach for real‑time simulations.  I further advanced this platform by incorporating complex, nonlinear surface kinetics, enabling accurate and scalable simulations of multicomponent systems and their mass‑transfer fluxes under nonequilibrium conditions.

Building on this platform, I applied the model to a pressing industrial problem: **catalyst deactivation** in sustainable aviation‑fuel production.  I developed and compared two theoretical models that connect molecular‑scale deactivation mechanisms with observable reactor‑scale performance degradation.  By analyzing industrial alkylation‑reaction data, I identified a previously unknown molecular compound that acts as a potent deactivating agent.  The models also revealed that the deactivation rate is highly sensitive to proton mobility on the catalyst surface.  This analysis offers a strategy for extending catalyst lifetime by optimizing proton interactions, providing a clear path to reduce downtime and improve the economic viability of sustainable fuel production.

Collectively, this work constitutes a complete “molecule‑to‑reactor” predictive pipeline, demonstrating a progression from method development to high‑impact industrial application.  The multiscale model was selected as the **cover article of *Chemical Engineering Science***, and the deactivation research earned me an invitation to present at the **Faraday Discussions**, a leading international forum for groundbreaking research.

## Blockchain Technology for Efficient Public‑Sector Schemes

To diversify my research, I explored how **blockchain technology** could improve transparency and efficiency in government welfare programs.  I proposed using blockchain as a **distributed ledger** for securely storing and managing beneficiary data, with smart contracts automating transactions to reduce human intervention.  We applied this framework to India’s flagship employment scheme, **MGNREGA**, which has an annual budget of around US$8 billion (2018–2019).  By leveraging cryptographic integrity and immutability, the system ensures funds are disbursed only to verified recipients and that all transactions are auditable, improving accountability and reducing fraud and inefficiency.

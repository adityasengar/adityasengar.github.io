## Developing a Generative AI Framework for All‑Atom Protein Dynamics

![LD‑FPG Figure](/images/LDFPG.png)

A significant challenge in computational biology is modeling the complete range of motion of proteins, as their 
function is intrinsically linked to their dynamics. To address this, I co‑conceived and led the development of a novel 
generative AI framework, **Latent Diffusion for Full Protein Generation (LD‑FPG)**.  

My specific contribution was central to this project: I designed and implemented the core machine‑learning pipeline,
which integrates a **spectral graph neural network autoencoder** with a **latent diffusion model**. I also performed
the rigorous validation of our method on a complex and medically relevant drug target – the **human dopamine D2
receptor (D2R)**, a G‑protein‑coupled receptor (GPCR).  

Our work demonstrated, for the first time, that a latent diffusion model can generate complete, all‑atom 
conformational ensembles directly from molecular dynamics data with high fidelity. The framework successfully reproduced
not only the **global backbone architecture** but also the **distributions of side‑chain dihedral angles** – dynamics
essential for molecular recognition.  

This achievement provides the scientific community with a powerful and computationally efficient tool to study the 
dynamics of challenging proteins, opening new avenues for structure‑based drug design against previously intractable
targets. In the spirit of open and reproducible science, I also curated and publicly released the extensive D2R 
molecular dynamics dataset and the complete LD‑FPG codebase to facilitate further innovation by other researchers.

### Video demonstration of LD‑FPG model (EPFL work)

To illustrate the power of our **Latent Diffusion for Full Protein Generation** framework, below are two clips
generated from our trained model.  The first shows raw molecular dynamics (MD) snapshots of the human PKC‑δ C1 domain 
followed by frames generated by LD‑FPG.  You can observe how the model faithfully captures backbone flexibility, helix 
breathing and loop motions.  The second clip shows another protein (3dAN). Once trained, LD‑FPG can generate thousands of 
physically realistic, all‑atom conformations in seconds—ideal for tasks such as ensemble docking, AI‑augmented scoring
and any workflow that requires a rich representation of protein motion.

## Major Achievements at Imperial — DNA Nanotechnology & Biomolecular Systems

![oxDNA Primer Figure](/images/oxdna.jpg)

I combined method development, simulations, and theoretical analysis to advance our understanding of DNA 
nanotechnology using the oxDNA framework. This work, showcased at five international conferences and through several 
posters, tackled fundamental challenges in DNA design and function.

### 1. Free‑energy mapping of four‑way DNA junctions

In this work, I developed enhanced sampling techniques based on oxDNA to map the free‑energy landscape of four‑way DNA 
junctions—crucial intermediates in strand‑displacement reactions. My simulations revealed a surprising result: 
introducing two bulges actually **destabilizes** the structure due to increased entropy penalties. This finding 
challenges conventional design assumptions and provides valuable insights for improving DNA nanostructure robustness.

### 2. Kinetic proofreading in nonenzymatic DNA strand displacement

Here, I applied oxDNA to model a **kinetic proofreading (KP)** mechanism in nonenzymatic DNA strand‑displacement 
systems. This work provided quantitative reaction‑rate estimates and showed that operating under out‑of‑equilibrium 
conditions significantly enhances molecular recognition—especially in discriminating single‑nucleotide mismatches. These
insights can inform highly specific applications such as SNP detection and DNA‑based diagnostics.

### 3. oxDNA primer: when to use it, how to simulate, how to interpret

We produced a detailed **primer and tutorial** on the oxDNA coarse‑grained DNA model. The article explains model
variants (oxDNA1/oxDNA2), force‑field details, sequence‑dependent parameterization and mapping to experimental
units. It also walks through simulation protocols—**Langevin dynamics**, **Monte Carlo** and advanced
accelerated sampling methods such as **Virtual Move Monte Carlo (VMMC)**—demonstrating how these can speed up
equilibration of large, strongly interacting DNA structures. We included worked examples where VMMC efficiently
explores conformations of DNA origami and multi‑strand assemblies and showed how to combine it with umbrella
sampling to obtain free‑energy profiles. The primer also details analysis workflows for computing structural
observables, thermodynamic quantities and reaction pathways, providing a benchmark reference for reproducible
oxDNA studies.

#### Additional method

I developed a **fast‑kinetics sampling workflow** in oxDNA to study dynamic events such as DNA bubble formation; this 
approach has since been adopted by groups at the University of Cambridge and MIT (submitted).

## Developing a “Molecule‑to‑Reactor” Computational Pipeline to Advance Catalytic Engineering

![Multiscale Catalyst Modeling](/images/reactor.jpg)

My research has focused on overcoming a critical barrier in chemical engineering: the inability of traditional 
models to bridge the vast gap between molecular‑level surface events and macroscopic reactor performance. To address 
this, I established a foundational, particle‑based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework that provides a unified,
multiscale view of catalytic processes. The core innovation of this framework was its ability to explicitly resolve 
essential small‑scale physics—such as diffusion and surface reactions—while seamlessly operating at the larger scales of
industrial reactors. This model was rigorously designed and validated to switch between reaction‑, diffusion‑, and 
convection‑dominated regimes, a versatility that was previously out of reach for real‑time simulations. I further 
advanced this platform by integrating complex, nonlinear surface reaction kinetics, enabling highly accurate and 
scalable simulations of multicomponent systems and their mass transfer fluxes under non‑equilibrium conditions.

Building on this robust modeling platform, I directed its predictive power toward solving a pressing industrial 
problem: **catalyst deactivation in the production of sustainable aviation fuels**, a primary cause of economic loss and
process inefficiency. I developed and compared two distinct theoretical models that quantitatively connect 
molecular‑scale deactivation mechanisms with observable reactor‑scale performance degradation. By applying these 
models to analyze industrial alkylation reaction data, my investigation yielded a crucial breakthrough: the 
identification of a previously unknown molecular compound that acts as a potent deactivating agent. Furthermore, the 
models revealed that the deactivation rate is highly sensitive to proton mobility on the catalyst surface. This analysis
provided a concrete, physics‑based strategy for extending catalyst lifetime by optimizing these proton interactions, 
offering a clear path to minimize operational downtime and improve the economic viability of sustainable fuel production.

Collectively, this work constitutes a complete “molecule‑to‑reactor” predictive pipeline, demonstrating a clear 
progression from **fundamental method development** to **high‑impact industrial application**. The multiscale model was 
selected as the **cover article of Chemical Engineering Science**, and the deactivation research earned me an 
invitation to present at the **Faraday Discussions**, a leading international forum for groundbreaking research. These 
results have been shared at multiple international conferences and directly with industry leaders, fostering 
collaborations that bridge academic theory and industrial practice.

## Blockchain Technology for Efficient Public‑Sector Schemes

To diversify my research, I explored how **blockchain technology** could enhance transparency and efficiency in 
government welfare programs. In this work I proposed using blockchain as a **distributed database** for securely 
storing and managing beneficiary data, with smart contracts automating transactions to reduce human intervention.  We 
applied this framework to India’s flagship employment scheme, **MGNREGA**, which has an annual budget of around US$8 
billion (2018–2019).  By leveraging cryptographic integrity and immutability, the system ensures that funds are 
disbursed only to verified recipients and that all transactions are auditable—improving accountability and reducing

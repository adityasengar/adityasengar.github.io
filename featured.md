### The Lab – A T M A N A

**Source:** ATMANA

**Summary:** This page details a collaborative project focused on creating simulations of humanity's future in the presence of AI. As a mathematician on the project, my work involved simulating outcomes based on whether human consciousness was focused internally (meditation) or externally, exploring the resulting dynamics between the human population and artificial intelligence.
